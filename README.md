# 👋 Hello! I'm Àlex! 🙃

I'm a UX Engineer (which means I am both a UX Designer and Front-end Developer, all in one package) based in ☀️ Barcelona 🏖️.

I like to design and build innovative and delightful experiences for the users 🥰. I am interested in techniques and tools that help me better understand my users and find the best way for them to enjoy the products that I work on.

👀 The latest thing to pique my interest is Design Systems. From the very beginning in design 🎨, setting up the foundation for the best guidelines, to the final step in development 💻, implementing adaptive and performant components, I want to learn, explore and finally contribute to this field.

📫 You can find me in almost all social media as `@alexmarles`, although I cannot promise that I'll be talking design, tech or code in there 🙃
